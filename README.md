# weather-application
Overview:
This Python-based weather application allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city or ZIP code. The application provides essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather description in a formal and minimalistic user interface with black text on a white background. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data and features a simple, user-friendly graphical interface created with Tkinter.

Key Features:

Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays current weather information.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a formal look using black text on a white background for readability and professionalism.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs or failed data retrieval.
Simple Input Handling: Users can enter either a city name or ZIP code to retrieve weather information.

How It Works:

API Integration:
The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. The API key is required for authentication and data access.

User Input:
The user enters a city name or ZIP code into a text entry field.

Data Retrieval:
Upon clicking the "Get Weather" button, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the provided location.
The request includes parameters such as the location, API key, and units (metric for Celsius).

Processing Response:
The application receives a JSON response from the API, containing weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather description.
The response is parsed to extract relevant data.

Displaying Results:
The extracted weather details are displayed on the interface, including the city name, temperature, humidity, and a brief description of the weather.

Error Handling:
If the user provides invalid input or if the API fails to retrieve data, the application displays an appropriate error message to guide the user.
Steps Followed in the Application:

Initialization:
Import necessary libraries: requests for API calls and tkinter for the GUI.
Define a function get_weather to handle API requests and responses.
Define a function display_weather to process user input, call the get_weather function, and update the GUI with weather information.
User Interface Setup:

Create the main application window using Tkinter.
Set the window size and title.
Configure the appearance with a formal style (black text on white background).
Create and configure widgets including labels, entry fields, and buttons.

Functionality Implementation:
Implement the get_weather function to make API calls and retrieve weather data.
Implement the display_weather function to handle user input, call get_weather, and update the UI with the fetched weather data.

Running the Application:
Start the Tkinter event loop to keep the application running and responsive to user actions.

Usage Instructions:
Setup:
Ensure that you have the required Python libraries (requests and tkinter).
Replace "your_openweathermap_api_key_here" in the script with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

Running the Application:
Run the Python script in your development environment.
The application window will open, presenting a formal user interface.
Enter a city name or ZIP code and click "Get Weather" to view current weather information.

Handling Errors:
If an invalid location is entered or data cannot be retrieved, an error message will be displayed to guide the user.
This application demonstrates fundamental Python skills including API integration, user input handling, and data manipulation, all while maintaining a professional and user-friendly interface.
